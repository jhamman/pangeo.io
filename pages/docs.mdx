## Connecting to the community

Pangeo Forge is a community run effort. There are multiple roles that people play to support the effort:

1. recipe contributors — contributors who write recipes to define the data conversions. This can be anyone with a desire to create analysis ready cloud-optimized (ARCO) data
1. bakery maintainers — contributors who deploy bakeries on cloud infrastructure to process and host the transformed data. This is typically an organization with a grant to fund the infrastructure

The safety and security of all community members is our top priority. Please familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pangeo-forge/roadmap/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
If you are new to Pangeo Forge and looking to get involved, we suggest getting started with recipe contribution. You can do in two ways:

1. Open a ticket with a dataset request (no code required!) - Get started [here](https://github.com/pangeo-forge/staged-recipes/issues/new/choose)
1. Write a recipe for a dataset you'd like to see transformed - See recipe creation docs
